    • Name
    • Email
    • Phone number
    • Option to select the day for the appointment. Users can't book an appointment for Sunday.
    • Weekdays should have hourly slots from 9 am to 5 pm. 1 pm to 2 pm is lunch break and can't be selected.
    • Saturday has slots from 9 am till 1 pm.
3. When the form is submitted, the details are saved in the database and a thank you screen is shown with the booking details.
4. Once a slot is booked, it should be disabled for any further bookings. Additional information:  5. Use SpringBoot.
